Greetings fellow sentients!

Fellow being of Earth here on an adventure of code! SQL and SAS are my MAMAJAM but I'm also interested in Python.
Speaking of I have a python named Shelia and a couple of fluffy cats. Glorious be to my fluffy masters who have been generous enough to not strike me down (so far).
